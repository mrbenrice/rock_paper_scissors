Update: Finished the rock paper scissors javascript file.
Big thanks to TOP discord & Lukahn from The Downbeat discord. They were great teachers and helped me grasp the concepts I need to start writing js code more effectively.

Update 2: Added DOM manipulation & new styles. Looks far better and I'm rather pleased. Again, a massive thank you to Lukahn for helping me with background placement!
